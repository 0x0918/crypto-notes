# Perfect Secrecy
**Formal Definition**: An encryption scheme $(\text{Gen}, \text{Enc}. \text{Dec})$ with message space $\mathcal{M}$ and ciphertext space $\mathcal{C}$ is **perfectly secret** if $\forall m \in \mathcal{M}$ and $\forall c \in \mathcal{C}$ where $\Pr[C=c] > 0$, it holds that:
$$
\Pr[M=m \mid C=c] = \Pr[M=m]
$$

I find this definition to be a thing of beauty. It is quite simple in logic: your idea about what a message may be at the start (_a priori_ probability, right-hand side) should be equal to what you think that message is after seeing the ciphertext (_a posteriori_ probability, left-hand side). If that is the case, seeing the cipher-text gave you no idea whatsoever.

_EXAMPLE:_ Consider the same shift cipher example from before, and notice that $\Pr[M=\text{"ten"} \mid C=\text{"rqh"}] = 0$. Since $\Pr[M=\text{"ten"}] = 1/2$, we can say this scheme is not perfectly secret.
